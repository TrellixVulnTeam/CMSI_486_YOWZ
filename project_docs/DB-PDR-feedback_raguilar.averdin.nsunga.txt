Rony and Alex and Nick ---

Good detail on this document.  Shows things at the appropriate
level for a preliminary design.

The ERD is very nice.  Is names a multivalued attribute?  Or is that
intended to be a composite attribute?

If you decide to stick with Neo, you might revise the ERD, so heads-up.

The example section should really contain 5 specific examples of what you
put for example number 3 in your document.  I'm looking for what the USER
will want to get out of the database *based on their search criteria*.

For example, "how many homicides involved multiple victims in 1984 - 1999?"
or "How may homicides were committed with baseball bats?"

Total: 9.5% out of 10% which is an A.
