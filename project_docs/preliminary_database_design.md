# Preliminary Database Design
## 1.1 Project Description
For our database design, we will be using Neo4j: a native graph database that is built to store, query and manage highly connected data. This will be the first time our team will be using Neo4j. If difficulty follows, we may consider switching to a more familiar DBMS. The users for this database is geared towards LAPD Detectives. The database is a part of a web application built off of the Django framework.

## 1.2 Data Description
The data that will be stored is information related to case files. These case files are supplied by the LAPD and pertain to their murder case books. Specifically, the types of data will be strings. These strings encompass information such as: victim names, suspect names, weapons, dates, and other relevant LAPD murder case information.
